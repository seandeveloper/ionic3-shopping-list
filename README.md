[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/skdigital/ionic3-shopping-list.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

This project was built by following Paul Halliday's online course Learn Ionic3 from Scratch.


### How to run the project with the Ionic CLI:

Download the zip file or fork the project and pull to a local directory, run 'npm install' from within the local directory and then run the command ionic lab or ionic serve. This will start a local development server.

If you open a browser and navigate to localhost:8100/ionic-lab you should find the app running.

Thanks for viewing the app and this readme.

(this app was built with Ionic3 and Angularfire2)
